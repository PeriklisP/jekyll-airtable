# Jekyll::Airtable

This gem enables you to easily integrate Airtable with Jekyll site and use it as a database. Everytime the Jekyll build is triggered, the gem would automatically send API request to the Airtable base and tables you specify from the environment variable and then store the records as collections, grouped according to the table names.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-airtable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

1. Because you will have to mention/use your API key, it is VERY RECOMMENDED to use dotenv so you do not have your API key lying around in plain sight.
```ruby
gem 'dotenv'
```
run bundle install again

2. Add this to your repo .gitignore (create one if does not exist):
```
.env
```

3. Copy the .env.example in this repo to the root of your project, rename it to .env.
4. Set your Airtable API Key in the .env

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY='your_airtable_api_key'
```

5. You need to add a custom plugin to get the dotenv to work, you do this by creating a folder ```_plugins``` (if does not exist already) inside your Jekyll repo
6. Inside the ```/_plugins ```, create a file called "environment_variables_generator.rb", with this as the content:

```ruby
# Plugin to add environment variables to the `site` object in Liquid templates
require 'dotenv'

module Jekyll
  class EnvironmentVariablesGenerator < Generator
    priority :highest
    
    def generate(site)
      Dotenv.overload
      site.config['env'] = Dotenv.overload

      site.config['AIRTABLE_API_KEY']   = ENV['AIRTABLE_API_KEY']
    end
  end
end
```

Now the secret keys can be accessed by Jekyll without being visible to the public.

7. Now, you need to declare and hook the plugins in the config.yml
```yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-airtable
  - environment_variables_generator

airtable:
  enable_sync: true
  base_uid: 'appp7C1MblPCnMePn'
  tables:
    - name: 'Use Cases' 
    - name: 'Whitepapers'    
    - name: 'Quotes'
      long_text_columns:
        - 'column name'
```

8. Finally, you can execute the plugin using ```sh bundle exec jekyll serve ``` or ```sh bundle exec jekyll build ```

For production, you also have to set those keys and values.

9. You then need to set the collections on the ```_config.yml ``` so that Jekyll recognizes them. The snippets below here are taken from https://github.com/galliani/airbase/blob/master/_config.yml. The collections on that repo are "use_cases", "whitepapers", and "tutorials", taken from the Airtable of "Use Cases", "Whitepapers", and "Tutorials" respectively.

```yml
collections_dir: collections
collections:
  use_cases:
    output: true
  whitepapers:
    output: true

defaults:
  - scope:
      type: "whitepapers"
    values:
      layout: "page" # any jekyll layout file you already have in the _layouts that you want to use for this collection type.
```


## Conventions

There are a number of "enforced" conventions you have to know and can take advantage of. 

1. By default, the slug of the record (which is the file name) come from this sources, in order of priority: 1) The column labelled 'Slug' / 'slug' in your Airtable table, 2) The primary key of each row (the first column on each table), 3) or the Airtable UID of the record. So if you want to set each record's slug manually, you can do so by creating slug column in your Airtable table.**GOTCHA:** Should slugs that are derived from priority 1 and 2 are both longer than 100 char, then it will automatically use the Airtable UID.

2. Attachments are not copied into your Jekyll repo but their informations, such as url and so on, will be stored in "_data/airtable/attachments.yml_" folder, if none exist before, this plugin will automatically create it for you.


3. Long text with paragraphs are now supported.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
